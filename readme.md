# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Problem statement
X Education, an online course provider, faces a challenge of low lead conversion rates despite a substantial influx of leads from various sources, including website visitors, forms, and referrals. While the company actively engages potential customers through sales efforts, the current lead conversion rate of approximately 30% is below the desired level. The company aims to improve lead conversion efficiency by identifying and prioritizing the most promising leads (so called hot leads), thus increasing the conversion rate to meet the target of 80%.


## Business Goal
The primary objective of X Education is to enhance its lead conversion process and achieve a higher conversion rate of 80%.
Additionally, a lead score between 0-100 should be assigned to each lead in order to identify hot leads
The company seeks to optimize its resources by focusing on leads with the highest potential for conversion, enabling the sales team to engage in more effective communication strategies.
By implementing a logistic regression model, X Education aims to assign lead scores that reflect the likelihood of conversion, allowing the sales team to prioritize leads and allocate resources efficiently.
